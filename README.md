# Highload Social Messenger

## Description

This project is a part of [Highload Social](https://github.com/eydeveloper/highload-social). It extends the main project
with messenger functionality.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed Docker
- You have installed Go

## Setup

To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/eydeveloper/highload-social-messenger.git
    ```

2. Start the Docker services:
    ```shell
    make up
    ```

3. Configue Redis Cluster.
    ```shell
    docker compose exec -it redis-node-1 sh
    redis-cli --cluster create localhost:7001 localhost:7002 localhost:7003 localhost:7004 localhost:7005 localhost:7006 --cluster-replicas 1
    ```

4. Start the server by running the following command:
    ```shell
    go run cmd/main.go
    ```

## Redis Cluster

Redis scales horizontally with a deployment topology called Redis Cluster. Redis Cluster provides a way to run a Redis
installation where data is automatically sharded across multiple Redis nodes. Redis Cluster also provides some degree of
availability during partitionsâ€”in practical terms, the ability to continue operations when some nodes fail or are unable
to communicate.

### Sharding strategies

Redis uses a hash-based sharding strategy to distribute keys across multiple nodes. This is implemented using the
following strategies:

1. Hash slot sharding:

    - Redis cluster uses a fixed set of 16384 hash slots.
    - Keys are mapped to hash slots using the CRC16 algorithm.
    - Each node in the cluster is responsible for a subset of these hash slots.
    - Example: Key foo hashes to slot 12182, so it will be stored in the node responsible for that slot.

2. Key tagging:

    - Key tags are used to ensure related keys are stored in the same hash slot.
    - Example: {user1}:name and {user1}:email will be hashed to the same slot because of the {user1} tag.

### Resharding process

Resharding basically means to move hash slots from a set of nodes to another set of nodes. Like cluster creation, it is
accomplished using the redis-cli utility.

1. Connect to any node in the cluster

    ```shell
    docker compose exec -it redis-node-1 sh
    redis-cli -c -h localhost -p <node-port>
    ```

2. Start the resharding process

   Enter the Redis CLI in cluster mode and use the CLUSTER command to reshard.

    ```shell
    redis-cli --cluster reshard localhost:<any-node-port>
    ```

3. Enter the total number of slots to move:

   When prompted, specify the number of hash slots you want to move.

    ```text
    How many slots do you want to move (from 1 to 16384)? <number-of-slots>
    ```

4. Specify the target node ID:

   Provide the ID of the node to which the slots should be moved. You can get the node IDs using:

    ```shell
    redis-cli -c -h localhost -p <node-port> cluster nodes
    ```

   Then, enter the target node ID when prompted.

    ```text
    What is the receiving node ID? <target-node-id>
    ```

5. Specify source node IDs:

   You can specify the source node IDs manually or let the system pick the source nodes automatically.

    ```text
    Source node #1: <source-node-id>
    ```

6. Confirm resharding:

    ```text
    Do you want to proceed with the proposed reshard plan (yes/no)? yes
    ```

   The resharding will then begin, and you will see output indicating the progress of slot migration.
